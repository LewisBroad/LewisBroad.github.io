  <h2>Dissertation Project: Divided</h2>
  <p>
    I created a coop puzzle game for my final year project. In this project, I was focusing on developing the game mainly using C++ in Unreal Engine 5. I created the multiplayer subsystem and I had replicated actor components for the puzzles. Here are some key features in the project:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Unique Character Abilities and Traits:</b> Each player controls one of two characters. I'm the characters have their own abilities such as being able to teleport, destroy walls and shoot targets which can be used to help them complete puzzles.</li>
    <li><b>Puzzles:</b> The aim of this game is to work together to solve puzzles and get to the end of the level. There are different ways of making it passed each obstacle and it is up to the players to figure out their own way.</li>
    <li><b>Thematic Environment:</b> The environment is telling a story. While the game can be played without a care for how the environment looks, I'd like players to be able to look around at the scenery and feel like there is a deeper story to be told.</li>
    <!-- Add more features as needed -->

        I got feedback from this test finding out some overlooked features that would've helped the players understand what they had to do. This feedback resulted in me adding highlighted surfaces to make it a bit more clear on the objective.

      <p>Here I demonstrate the first prototype for the teleporter character. The way this is used is that the player presses a button to activate a teleporting state and can see visually where they are teleporting to. 
        A Boolean is used to determine whether the player was in this state or not and in the update function, it uses a line trace that is used to detect where the player is aiming at. 
        This is the base trace for detecting the location but there is a second line trace after this that detects walls using a dot product of the location the returns. 
        If the dot product returns under a certain amount, then the teleport is valid and the player is free to teleport to that location. <br>
        An issue that came up was that the player was teleporting through the floor because the teleport would move the players centre to the location, but this was easily fixed by adding the player capsule’s half-height to the Y-axis. 
        Finally allowing the character to be able to teleport through certain meshes, with that being glass, this requires the need to create a new trace channel so that the trace ignored certain collision presets. 
        One was created for the teleporting trace that was blocked by everything but on glass it ignores the collision and allows the player to teleport through.</p>

          <h2>Unreal Engine: Fight Lab</h2>
          <p>In my first project in unreal engine, me and some others in my class created a melee combat game. 
            I was in charge of the code of the game, the levels and the gameplay. 
            I created the AI which used the same animation and fighting mechanics as the player and had the instructions to walk towards the player and attack when close. 
            The aim is to defeat all the enemies and that will allow the player to proceed through a portal.</p>

          <h2>Animation</h2>
          <p>In addition to developing games, I have also been learning animation. 
            I had been tasked with making animations using IK constraints, parent and child linking, and character rigging. 
            I learned to use Maya in this time to create animations but decided to create my animation in Unreal Engine 5 as I wanted to enhance my skills in this engine. 
            I used face tracking and manually rigged the movement of the characters in my animation.

  <h2>Unity Engine Roguelike</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently developing a roguelike game in the unity engine in my spare time. This game is very early in development but I have big plans for the future of this game. 
    The game will feature the gameplay loop of landing on new planets, killing enemies, looting, diving deeper into the planet for better loot and harder enemies, and completing a timed extraction.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Character Selection</b> Each playthrough you will be able to play as one of the selectable characters. Each will different playstyles.</li>
    <li><b>Party System</b> After your selected character is chosen, it will be time to choose your team from all the non-selected characters.</li>
    <li><b>Upgrades</b> After each extraction, aboard your ship you will be able to upgrade yourself and your party. Whether that be stat upgrades or upgrades to your abilities.</li>
    <li><b>Different Environments</b> There are plans to feature different planets with unique variations of enemies on them. </li>
    <li><b>Extractions</b> Extractions will be able to be called in towards the ending of the level. These will require time and defending to complete but once you have done this, you will leave the planet.</li>

          <p>My first project was made in unity. 
            It was a racing game. We were graded on the overall level design and not just the coding elements of the level. 
            We were encouraged to use the asset store using assets that fit our overall theme.  I created a race track in the country with a lake, forest and mountains. 
            I enjoyed decorating the map with models such as the hot air balloons, fan stands, emergency vehicles and a penguin.</p>

          <p>I made a 2D zombie shooter game in which we were graded mainly on the coding. 
            The game uses pooling for the spawning of enemies and bullets.  
            The game is timed and ends on the characters health hitting 0 or the time. The aim is to eliminate as many zombies as possible in the given time. 
            An issue I had with the game was that the projectiles fired from the player would collide with the player and so sometimes would seemingly not fire. 
            To fix this, I had a separate entity for the gun that follows the player and fires from that.</p>

            I, along with another student handled the coding in our game whereas another two created the sound and the sprites. 
            My main part was the boss fight. The player will be locked into the boss fight where the boss will shoot normal bullets at the player. 
            Upon hitting half health, the boss' speed will double and they will shoot homing missiles at the player.</p>

          <p>I created 4 shaders for my shaders module. We were taught different shaders and here is what I made for my assignment:</p>
            <li>A good idea I had was to combine the cube map and the mirror shader I learned a tweak them a little. 
            I added a code that detected if the player was near enough so you could see a different cube map such as if you were looking through a window and I had the "Mirror" there to just reflect the player position in the texture.</li>
            <li>I made a wave shader that moved along a wave frequency with an animated texture on top to simulate the ocean. </li>
            <li>I created a rusting texture that would change the roughness and glossiness of a texture over time.</li>
            <li>Lastly I created a dissolving texture that took a bump map and dissolved the model according to the difference.</li>

          <h2>C++ Advanced Programming</h2>
          <p>I created a C++ test based game for one of my projects. Originally this was a project I started over the summer but figured I can use it as one of my university projects.
            This game is an adventure game with character classes that set the characters initial stats. For example the Knight class has High armour and HP but lower attack damage, whereas the rogue class is the opposite to this.
            The game has the player wondering around and has a random encounter chance with there currently being 2 encounters. These being an enemy will spawn from either a tank enemy or a damage enemy (I called them a magic tree and a goblin.) 
            And a magic gnome that will buff the player or laugh and leave. This project was ultimately a skills test for my knowledge in C++ and I utilised multiple methods such as exception handling, memory management, winsock, and overloading.
            This project I did get carried away with because I was enjoying adding more content to the game but I had to remove some features as we were limited to a 10 class limit.

          <p>My task when working with OpenGL was to create a walking dog. 
            Which meant that I had to create the entire dog from code and have it walk and physically move as well. 
            I had to animate the limbs of the dog to move when the dog was moving. In addition to this, I had to add texture mapping to the dog and also add lighting to the scene.</p>
