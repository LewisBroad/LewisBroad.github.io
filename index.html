  <h2>Current Project: [Untitled Coop Game]</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently working on a coop puzzle game for my final year project. In this project, I am focusing on developing the game mainly using C++ in Unreal Engine 5. I have created the multiplayer subsystem and I already have replicated actor components for the puzzles. Here are some key features I have planned for the project:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Unique Character Abilities and Traits:</b> Each player will control one of two characters. I'm planning for the characters to have their own abilities such as being able to break glass and traits such as weight used to help them complete puzzles.</li>
    <li><b>Random Generated Puzzles:</b> Another feature I'm implementing is for puzzle answers to be random each time the game is played. This gives the player a slight change each time and means that the puzzles can not be immediately skipped if the player knows the answer.</li>
    <li><b>Thematic Environment:</b> The environment I have planned is going to tell a story. While the game can be played without a care for how the environment looks, I'd like players to be able to look around at the scenery and feel like there is a deeper story to be told.</li>
    <!-- Add more features as needed -->
  </ul>

          <h2>Project 1: Funky Ride</h2>
          <p>My first project was made in unity. 
            It was a racing game. We were graded on the overall level design and not just the coding elements of the level. 
            We were encouraged to use the asset store using assets that fit our overall theme.  I created a race track in the country with a lake, forest and mountains. 
            I enjoyed decorating the map with models such as the hot air balloons, fan stands, emergency vehicles and a penguin.

          <h2>Project 2: Baldy vs Zombie2</h2>
          <p>I made a 2D zombie shooter game in which we were graded mainly on the coding. 
            The game uses pooling for the spawning of enemies and bullets.  
            The game is timed and ends on the characters health hitting 0 or the time. The aim is to eliminate as many zombies as possible in the given time. 
            An issue I had with the game was that the projectiles fired from the player would collide with the player and so sometimes would seemingly not fire. 
            To fix this, I had a separate entity for the gun that follows the player and fires from that.</p>

            I was in charge of the code of the game, the levels and the gameplay. 
            I created the AI which used the same animation and fighting mechanics as the player and had the instructions to walk towards the player and attack when close. 
            The aim is to defeat all the enemies and that will allow the player to proceed through a portal.</p>

            I, along with another student handled the coding in our game whereas another two created the sound and the sprites. 
            My main part was the boss fight. The player will be locked into the boss fight where the boss will shoot normal bullets at the player. 
            Upon hitting half health, the boss' speed will double and they will shoot homing missiles at the player.</p>

          <h2>C++ Advanced Programming</h2>
          <p>I created a C++ test based game for one of my projects. Originally this was a project I started over the summer but figured I can use it as one of my university projects.
            This game is an adventure game with character classes that set the characters initial stats. For example the Knight class has High armour and HP but lower attack damage, whereas the rogue class is the opposite to this.
            The game has the player wondering around and has a random encounter chance with there currently being 2 encounters. These being an enemy will spawn from either a tank enemy or a damage enemy (I called them a magic tree and a goblin.) 
            And a magic gnome that will buff the player or laugh and leave. This project was ultimately a skills test for my knowledge in C++ and I utilised multiple methods such as exception handling, memory management, winsock, and overloading.
            This project I did get carried away with because I was enjoying adding more content to the game but I had to remove some features as we were limited to a 10 class limit. <p>NOTE: I am currently awaiting my mark for this project so it is not available for viewing yet</p>

          <h2>Animation</h2>
          <p>In addition to developing games, I have also been learning animation. 
            I had been tasked with making animations using IK constraints, parent and child linking, and character rigging. 
            I learned to use Maya in this time to create animations but decided to create my animation in Unreal Engine 5 as I wanted to enhance my skills in this engine. 
            I used face tracking and manually rigged the movement of the characters in my animation.

          <h2>Unity Shaders</h2>
          <p>I created 4 shaders for my shaders module. We were taught different shaders and here is what I made for my assignment:</p>
            <li>A good idea I had was to combine the cube map and the mirror shader I learned a tweak them a little. 
            I added a code that detected if the player was near enough so you could see a different cube map such as if you were looking through a window and I had the "Mirror" there to just reflect the player position in the texture.</li>
            <li>I made a wave shader that moved along a wave frequency with an animated texture on top to simulate the ocean. </li>
            <li>I created a rusting texture that would change the roughness and glossiness of a texture over time.</li>
            <li>Lastly I created a dissolving texture that took a bump map and dissolved the model according to the difference.</li>

          <h2>OpenGL</h2>
          <p>My task when working with OpenGL was to create a walking dog. 
            Which meant that I had to create the entire dog from code and have it walk and physically move as well. 
            I had to animate the limbs of the dog to move when the dog was moving. In addition to this, I had to add texture mapping to the dog and also add lighting to the scene.</p>
